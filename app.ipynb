Buhari earned a taciturn reputation during the presidency of\\nShehu Shagari\\ndue to his leading troops in the\\nChadian–Nigerian War\\n. Buhari was a main figure behind the\\n1983 Nigerian coup d\\'état\\nwhich led to the overthrow of the\\nSecond Republic\\n. Although not the ringleader, Buhari became head of the\\nmilitary junta\\namid a period of deep economic crisis and widespread corruption. Citing economic mismanagement and a lack of discipline under the civilian administration, Buhari adopted a strict and austere approach to governance, with a strong emphasis on discipline, anti-corruption, and economic recovery through what became known as the\\nWar Against Indiscipline\\n(WAI). The\\nauthoritarian\\npolitical system he created is known as\\nBuharism\\n. Ultimately, Buhari\\'s rigid style of governance and strained economic measures led to growing dissatisfaction within the military. On 27 August 1985, he was\\noverthrown in a palace coup\\nled by General\\nIbrahim Babangida\\n.\\nBuhari ran for president of Nigeria on the platform and support of the\\nAll Nigeria Peoples Party\\n(ANPP) in\\n2003\\nand\\n2007\\n, and on the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) platform in\\n2011\\n.\\n[\\n4\\n]\\nIn December 2014, he emerged as the presidential candidate of\\n[\\n5\\n]\\nthe\\nAll Progressives Congress\\nparty for the\\n2015 general election\\n.\\n[\\n6\\n]\\nBuhari won the election, defeating incumbent President\\nGoodluck Jonathan\\n.\\n[\\n7\\n]\\nIt was the first time in the history of Nigeria that an incumbent president lost a re-election bid. He was sworn in on 29 May 2015. In February 2019, Buhari was\\nre-elected\\n, defeating his closest rival, former Vice President\\nAtiku Abubakar\\n, by over 3 million votes.\\n[\\n8\\n]\\n[\\n9\\n]\\n[\\n10\\n]\\n[\\n11\\n]\\nEarly life\\nMuhammadu Buhari was born on 17 December 1942, in\\nDaura\\n, now in Katsina State, Nigeria.\\n[\\n12\\n]\\n[\\n13\\n]\\nHe was the twenty-third child of Mallam Hardo Adamu, a\\nFula\\nchieftain originally from Dumurkul in\\nMai\\'Adua\\nand Zulaihat, who had\\nHausa\\nand\\nKanuri\\nancestry.\\n[\\n12\\n]\\n[\\n14\\n]\\nHe was named after ninth-century Islamic scholar\\nMuhammad al-Bukhari\\n.\\n[\\n15\\n]\\nBuhari\\'s great-grandfather, Yusuf, was a chieftain, who had established several settlements in Daura, including Dumurkul.\\n[\\n14\\n]\\nBuhari\\'s father died when he was 4 years old, and Waziri Alhassan, the son of the\\nEmir of Daura\\n, Musa dan Nuhu (\\nreigned\\n: 1904–1911),\\n[\\n16\\n]\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nbecame the guardian of Zulaihat and her six children, including Buhari.\\n[\\n14\\n]\\nBuhari attended\\nQur\\'anic school\\n, where he helped in rearing cattle. He had his primary education in Daura and Mai\\'Adua, and graduated in 1953. He was admitted into Katsina Middle School (later renamed to Katsina Provincial Secondary School), where he had his secondary education from 1956 to 1961. During his\\nsixth form\\n, he served as the house captain and\\nheadboy\\nof the school. In 1960, he was awarded scholarship by the\\nElder Dempster Lines\\nfor a summer visit to the\\nUnited Kingdom\\n.\\n[\\n14\\n]\\nBuhari wanted to pursue a medical degree to become a doctor; the only option at the time was to study\\nPharmacology\\nat the Nigerian College of Arts, Science, and Technology in\\nZaria\\n, which would take him many years. His nephew\\nMamman Daura\\nadvised him to join the\\nNigerian military\\nand pursue higher education there.\\n[\\n14\\n]\\nMilitary career\\nIn 1962, at the age of 19, Buhari was one of 70 boys selected for recruitment into the\\nNigerian Military Training College\\n(NMTC).\\n[\\n18\\n]\\n[\\n14\\n]\\nIn February 1964, NMTC was upgraded to an officer commissioning unit of the\\nNigerian Army\\nand was renamed\\nNigerian Defence Academy\\n. From 1962 to 1963, Buhari underwent officer cadet training at\\nMons Officer Cadet School\\nin\\nAldershot\\n, England.\\n[\\n19\\n]\\nIn January 1963, at the age of 20, he was commissioned a second lieutenant and appointed\\nPlatoon Commander\\nof the Second Infantry Battalion in\\nAbeokuta\\n, Nigeria, and attended the Platoon Commanders\\' Course at the Nigerian Military Training College,\\nKaduna\\n, Kaduna State, from November 1963 to January 1964. In 1964, he further moved to the Mechanical Transport Officer\\'s Course at the Army Mechanical Transport School in Borden,\\nUnited Kingdom\\n.\\n[\\n20\\n]\\nFrom 1965 to 1967, Buhari served as commander of the Second Infantry Battalion and was appointed\\nbrigade major\\nof the Second Sector, First Infantry Division (April 1967 to July 1967). Following the\\n1966 Nigerian coup d\\'état\\nthat killed the\\nPremier of Northern Nigeria\\nAhmadu Bello\\n, Buhari, alongside other officers from\\nNorthern Nigeria\\n, took part in the\\nJuly counter-coup\\n, which ousted General\\nAguiyi Ironsi\\n, replacing him with General\\nYakubu Gowon\\n.\\n[\\n21\\n]\\nNigerian Civil War\\nMain article:\\nNigerian Civil War\\nBuhari was assigned to the\\n1st Division\\nunder the command of Lieutenant Colonel\\nMohammed Shuwa\\n.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nThe division had temporarily moved from Kaduna to\\nMakurdi\\nat the onset of the\\nNigerian Civil War\\n. The 1st division was divided into sectors and battalions, with Shuwa assisted by sector commanders Martin Adamu and Sule Apollo, who was later replaced by\\nTheophilus Danjuma\\n.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nHe first served as the\\nAdjutant\\nand\\nCompany Commander\\n2 battalion unit, Second Sector Infantry of the 1st Division. The 2 battalion was one of the units that participated in the first actions of the war: they started from Gakem near\\nAfikpo\\nand moved towards\\nOgoja\\n, with support from\\nGado Nasko\\n\\'s artillery squad.\\n[\\n24\\n]\\nThey reached and captured Ogoja, with the intention of advancing through the flanks to\\nEnugu\\n, the capital city.\\n[\\n25\\n]\\nHe was briefly the 2 battalion\\'s Commander and led the battalion to Afikpo to merge with the 3rd Marine Commando and advance towards Enugu through Nkalagu and\\nAbakaliki\\n. However, before the move to Enugu, he was posted to\\nNsukka\\nas Brigade Major of the 3rd Infantry Brigade under Joshua Gin, who was later replaced by Isa Bukar.\\n[\\n26\\n]\\nBuhari stayed with the infantry for a few months as the Nigerian army began to adjust tactics learnt from early battle experiences. Instead of swift advances, the new tactics involved securing and holding on to the lines of communications and using captured towns as training ground to train new recruits brought in from the army depots in\\nAbeokuta\\nand\\nZaria\\n.\\n[\\n26\\n]\\nIn 1968, he was posted to the 4 Sector, also called the Awka sector, which was charged with taking over the capture of Onitsha from Division 2. The sector\\'s operations were within the\\nAwka\\n-\\nAbagana\\n-Onitsha region, which was important to\\nBiafran\\nforces because it was a major source of food supply. It was in the sector that Buhari\\'s group suffered a lot of casualties trying to protect the food supplies route of the rebels along\\nOji River\\nand\\nAbagana\\n.\\n[\\n27\\n]\\nAfter the war\\nFrom 1970 to 1971, Buhari was Brigade Major/Commandant, 31st Infantry Brigade. He then served as the Assistant Adjutant-General, First Infantry Division Headquarters, from 1971 to 1972. He also attended the\\nDefence Services Staff College\\n,\\nWellington Cantonment\\n, India, in 1973.\\n[\\n28\\n]\\nFrom 1974 to 1975 Buhari was acting director of Transport and Supply at the Nigerian Army Corps of Supply and Transport Headquarters.\\n[\\n29\\n]\\nIn the\\n1975 military coup d\\'état\\n, Lieutenant Colonel Buhari was among a group of officers that brought General\\nMurtala Mohammed\\nto power. He was later appointed Governor of the\\nNorth-Eastern State\\n[\\n30\\n]\\n[\\n31\\n]\\nfrom 1 August 1975 to 3 February 1976, to oversee social, economic and political improvements in the state. On 3 February 1976, the North Eastern State was divided into three states\\nBauchi\\n,\\nBorno\\nand\\nGongola\\n.\\n[\\n32\\n]\\n[\\n33\\n]\\n[\\n34\\n]\\nBuhari then became the first Governor of Borno State from 3 February 1976 to 15 March 1976.\\n[\\n35\\n]\\nIn March 1976, following the botched\\n1976 military coup d\\'état attempt\\nwhich led to the assassination of General Murtala Mohammed, his deputy General\\nOlusegun Obasanjo\\nbecame the military head of state and appointed Colonel Buhari as the\\nFederal Commissioner for Petroleum and Natural Resources\\n(now minister). In 1977, when the\\nNigerian National Petroleum Corporation\\nwas created, Buhari was appointed as its chairman, a position he held until 1978.\\n[\\n36\\n]\\nDuring his tenure as the Federal Commissioner for Petroleum and Natural Resources, the government invested in pipelines and petroleum storage infrastructures. The government built about 21 petroleum storage depots all over the country from Lagos to\\nMaiduguri\\nand from\\nCalabar\\nto\\nGusau\\n; the administration constructed a pipeline network that connected Bonny terminal and the Port Harcourt refinery to the depots. Also, the administration signed the contract for the construction of a refinery in\\nKaduna\\nand an oil pipeline that would connect the Escravos oil terminal to Warri Refinery and the proposed Kaduna refinery.\\n[\\n37\\n]\\nDuring his tenure as Federal Commissioner of Petroleum and Natural Resources, US$2.8 billion allegedly went missing from the accounts of the\\nNigerian National Petroleum Corporation\\n(NNPC) in\\nMidlands Bank\\nin the United Kingdom. General Ibrahim Babangida later allegedly accused Buhari of being responsible for this fraud.\\n[\\n38\\n]\\n[\\n39\\n]\\n[\\n40\\n]\\nHowever, in the conclusion of the\\nCrude Oil\\nSales Tribunal of Inquiry headed by Justice\\nAyo Irikefe\\nto investigate allegations of 2.8 billion Dollars misappropriation from the NNPC account, the tribunal found no truth in the allegations even though it noticed some lapses in the NNPC accounts.\\n[\\n41\\n]\\nFrom 1978 to 1979, he was Military Secretary at the Army Headquarters and was a member of the\\nSupreme Military Council\\nfrom 1978 to 1979. From 1979 to 1980, at the rank of colonel, Buhari (class of 1980) attended the\\nUS Army War College\\nin\\nCarlisle, Pennsylvania\\n, in the\\nUnited States\\n, and gained a\\nmaster\\'s degree\\nin\\nStrategic Studies\\n.\\n[\\n42\\n]\\n[\\n43\\n]\\nUpon completion of the on-campus full-time resident program lasting ten months and the two-year-long, distance learning program, the\\nUnited States Army War College\\n(USAWC) awards its graduate officers a master\\'s degree in Strategic Studies.\\n[\\n44\\n]\\nIn 1983, when Chadian forces invaded Nigeria in the Borno State, Buhari used the forces under his command to chase them out of the country, crossing into Chadian territory in spite of an order given by President Shagari to withdraw.\\n[\\n45\\n]\\nThis 1983 Chadian military affair led to more than 100 victims and \"prisoners of war\".\\n[\\n45\\n]\\nDivisional commands held in the\\nNigerian Army\\n:\\nGeneral Officer Commanding, 4th Infantry Division: August 1980 – January 1981\\n[\\n46\\n]\\nGeneral Officer Commanding,\\n2nd Mechanised Infantry Division\\n: January 1981 – October 1981\\n[\\n47\\n]\\nGeneral Officer Commanding,\\n3rd Armed Division\\n: October 1981 – December 1983\\nCoup d\\'état of 1983\\nMain article:\\n1983 Nigerian coup d\\'état\\nMajor-General Buhari was one of the leaders of the\\nmilitary coup of December 1983\\nthat overthrew the\\nSecond Nigerian Republic\\n. At the time of the coup plot, Buhari was the General Officer Commanding (GOC), Third Armoured Division of\\nJos\\n.\\n[\\n48\\n]\\nWith the successful execution of the coup,\\nTunde Idiagbon\\nwas appointed Chief of General Staff (the\\nde facto\\nNo. 2 in the administration). The coup ended Nigeria\\'s short-lived\\nSecond Republic\\n, a period of multi-party\\ndemocracy\\nrevived in 1979, after 13 years of military rule.\\n[\\n49\\n]\\nAccording to\\nThe New York Times\\n, the officers who took power argued that \"a flawed democracy was worse than no democracy at all\". Buhari justified the military\\'s seizure of power by castigating the civilian government as hopelessly corrupt and promptly suspended the\\nconstitution\\n. Another rationale for the coup was to correct economic decline in Nigeria. In the military\\'s first broadcast after the coup, Sani Abacha linked \\'an inept and corrupt leadership\\'\\n[\\n50\\n]\\nwith general economic decline. In Buhari\\'s New Year\\'s Day speech, he too mentioned the corrupt class of the\\nSecond Republic\\nbut also as the cause of a general decline in morality in society.\\n[\\n50\\n]\\nHead of state (1983–1985)\\nConsolidation of power\\nThe structure of the new military leadership—the fifth in\\nNigeria\\nsince independence—resembled the last military regime, the\\nObasanjo\\n/\\nYaradua\\nadministration. The new regime established a Supreme Military Council, a Federal Executive Council and a Council of States.\\n[\\n51\\n]\\nThe number of ministries was trimmed to 18, while the administration carried out a retrenchment exercise among the senior ranks of the civil service and police. It retired 17 permanent secretaries and some senior police and naval officers. In addition, the new military administration promulgated new laws to achieve its aim. These laws included the Robbery and Firearms (Special Provisions) Decree for the prosecution of armed robbery cases, and the State Security (Detention of Person) Decree, which gave powers to the military to detain individuals suspected of jeopardizing state security or causing economic adversity.\\n[\\n52\\n]\\nOther decrees included the Civil Service Commission and Public Offenders Decree, which constituted the legal and administrative basis to conduct a purge in the civil service.\\n[\\n52\\n]\\nAccording to Decree Number 2 of 1984, the state security and the chief of staff were given the power to detain, without charges, individuals deemed to be a security risk to the state for up to three months.\\n[\\n53\\n]\\nStrikes and popular demonstrations were banned and Nigeria\\'s security agency, the\\nNational Security Organization\\n(NSO) was entrusted with unprecedented powers. The NSO played a wide role in the cracking down of public dissent by intimidating, harassing and jailing individuals who broke the interdiction on strikes. By October 1984, about 200,000 civil servants were retrenched.\\n[\\n54\\n]\\nBuhari mounted an offensive against entrenched interests. In 20 months as Head of State, about 500 politicians, officials and businessmen were jailed for corruption during his stewardship.\\n[\\n55\\n]\\n[\\n56\\n]\\nDetainees were released after releasing sums to the government and agreeing to meet certain conditions. The regime also jailed its critics, including\\nFela Kuti\\n.\\n[\\n57\\n]\\nHe was arrested on 4 September 1984 at the airport as he was about to embark on an American tour.\\nAmnesty International\\ndescribed the charges brought against him for illegally exporting foreign currency as \"spurious\". Using the wide powers bestowed upon it by Decree Number 2, the government sentenced Fela to five years in prison. He was released after 18 months,\\n[\\n57\\n]\\nwhen the Buhari regime was overthrown.\\nThe\\nDikko Affair\\nwas another defining moment in Buhari\\'s military government.\\nUmaru Dikko\\n, a former Minister of Transportation under the previous civilian administration of President Shagari who had fled the country shortly after the coup, was accused of embezzling $1 billion in oil profits. With the help of an alleged former Mossad agent, the\\nNSO\\ntraced him to London, where operatives from Nigeria and Israel drugged and kidnapped him. They placed him in a plastic bag, which was subsequently hidden inside a crate labelled as \"Diplomatic Baggage\". The purpose of this secret operation was to ship Dikko off to Nigeria on an empty Nigerian Airways Boeing 707, to stand trial for embezzlement. The plot was foiled by British airport officers.\\n[\\n58\\n]\\nBuhari\\'s administration was embroiled in a scandal concerning the fate of 53 suitcases with unknown contents.\\n[\\n59\\n]\\nThe suitcases were being transported by the Emir of Gwandu, whose son was Buhari\\'s aide-de-camp, and were cleared through customs on 10 June 1984 without inspection during his return flight from Saudi Arabia.\\n[\\n60\\n]\\nIn 1984, Buhari passed Decree Number 4, the Protection Against False Accusations Decree,\\n[\\n61\\n]\\na wide-ranging repressive press law. Section 1 of the law provided that \"Any person who publishes in any form, whether written or otherwise, any message, rumour, report or statement [...] which is false in any material particular or which brings or is calculated to bring the Federal Military Government or the Government of a state or public officer to ridicule or disrepute, shall be guilty of an offence under this Decree\".\\n[\\n62\\n]\\nThe law further stated that offending journalists and publishers would be tried by an open military tribunal, whose ruling would be final and unappealable in any court and those found guilty would be eligible for a fine not less than 10,000\\nnaira\\nand a jail sentence of up to two years.\\n[\\n63\\n]\\nEconomics\\nMain article:\\nBuharism\\nBuhari in uniform\\nIn order to reform the economy, as Head of State, Buhari started to rebuild the nation\\'s social-political and economic systems, along the realities of Nigeria\\'s austere economic conditions.\\n[\\n64\\n]\\nThe rebuilding included removing or cutting back the excesses in national expenditure, obliterating or removing completely, corruption from the nation\\'s social ethics, shifting from mainly public-sector employment to self-employment. Buhari also encouraged import substitution industrialisation based to a great extent on the use of local materials.\\n[\\n64\\n]\\nHowever, tightening of imports led to reduction in raw materials for industries causing many industries to operate below capacity,\\n[\\n65\\n]\\nreduction of workers and in some cases business closure.\\n[\\n55\\n]\\nBuhari broke ties with the\\nInternational Monetary Fund\\n(IMF), when the fund asked the government to devalue the naira by 60%. However, the reforms that Buhari instigated on his own were as rigorous as, or more so than, those required by the IMF.\\n[\\n66\\n]\\n[\\n67\\n]\\nOn 7 May 1984, Buhari announced the country\\'s 1984 National Budget. The budget came with a series of complementary measures:\\nA temporary ban on recruiting federal public sector workers\\nRaising of interest rates\\nHalting capital projects\\nProhibition of borrowing by state governments\\n15% cut from Shagari\\'s 1983 Budget\\nRealignment of import duties\\nReducing the balance of payment deficit by cutting imports\\nIt also gave priority to the importation of raw materials and spare parts that were needed for agriculture and industry.\\nOther economic measures by Buhari took the form of countertrade, currency change, price reduction of goods and services. His economic policies did not earn him the legitimacy of the masses due to the rise in inflation and the use of military might to continue to push many policies blamed for the rise in food prices.\\n[\\n68\\n]\\nMass social mobilization\\nMain article:\\nWar Against Indiscipline\\nOne of the most enduring legacies of the Buhari government has been the\\nWar Against Indiscipline\\n(WAI). Launched on 20 March 1984, the policy tried to address the perceived lack of public morality and civic responsibility of Nigerian society. Unruly Nigerians were ordered to form neat queues at bus stops, under the eyes of whip-wielding soldiers. Civil servants\\n[\\n69\\n]\\nwho failed to show up on time at work were humiliated and forced to do \"frog jumps\". Minor offenses carried long sentences, for example, any student over the age of 17 caught cheating on an exam would get 21 years in prison. More serious offenses like counterfeiting and arson could lead to the death penalty.\\n[\\n70\\n]\\nBuhari\\'s administration enacted three decrees to investigate corruption and control foreign exchange. The Banking (Freezing of Accounts) Decree of 1984, allotted to the Federal Military Government the power to freeze bank accounts of persons suspected to have committed fraud. The Recovery of Public Property (Special Military Tribunals) Decree permitted the government to investigate the assets of public officials linked with corruption and constitute a military tribunal to try such persons. The Exchange Control (Anti-Sabotage) Decree stated penalties for violators of foreign exchange laws.\\n[\\n71\\n]\\nDecree 20 on illegal ship bunkering and drug trafficking was another example of Buhari\\'s tough approach to crime.\\n[\\n72\\n]\\nSection 3 (2) (K) provided that \"any person who, without lawful authority deals in, sells, smokes or inhales the drug known as\\ncocaine\\nor other similar drugs, shall be guilty under section 6 (3) (K) of an offence and liable on conviction to suffer death sentence by firing squad.\" In the case of Bernard Ogedengebe, the Decree was applied retroactively.\\n[\\n73\\n]\\nHe was executed even if at the time of his arrest the crime did not mandate the capital punishment, but had carried a sentence of six months imprisonment.\\n[\\n73\\n]\\nIn another prominent case of April 1985, six Nigerians were condemned to death under the same decree: Sidikatu Tairi, Sola Oguntayo, Oladele Omosebi, Lasunkanmi Awolola, Jimi Adebayo and Gladys Iyamah.\\n[\\n74\\n]\\nIn 1985, prompted by economic uncertainties and a rising crime rate, Buhari\\'s government opened the borders (closed since April 1984) with\\nBenin\\n,\\nNiger\\n,\\nChad\\nand\\nCameroon\\nto speed up the expulsion of 700,000 illegal foreigners and illegal migrant workers.\\n[\\n75\\n]\\nBuhari is today known for this crisis; there was even a famine in the east of Niger that has been named \"El Buhari\".\\n[\\n76\\n]\\nHis regime drew criticism from many, including Nigeria\\'s first Nobel Prize winner\\nWole Soyinka\\n, who, in 2007, wrote a piece called \"The Crimes of Buhari\"\\n[\\n77\\n]\\nin which he accused Buhari of overseeing numerous abuses during his time as a military ruler.\\nAhead of the 2015 general election, Buhari responded to his human rights criticism by saying that if elected, he would follow the rule of law, and that there would be access to justice for all Nigerians and respect for fundamental human rights of Nigerians.\\n[\\n78\\n]\\nCoup d\\'état of 1985\\nMain article:\\n1985 Nigerian coup d\\'état\\nIn August 1985, Major General Buhari was overthrown in a coup led by Major General\\nIbrahim Babangida\\nand other members of the ruling Supreme Military Council (SMC).\\n[\\n79\\n]\\nBabangida brought many of Buhari\\'s most vocal critics into his administration, including\\nFela Kuti\\n\\'s brother\\nOlikoye Ransome-Kuti\\n, a doctor who had led a strike against Buhari to protest declining health care services.

In 2013, Muhammadu Buhari made a series of statements, when he asked the Federal Government to stop the killing of Boko Haram members and blamed the rise of the terrorist group on the prevalence of\\nNiger Delta militants\\nin the South.

There were four programs which aimed to address poverty, unemployment and help increase economic development:\\n[\\n162\\n]\\nThe\\nN-Power\\nprogram provided young Nigerians with job training and education, as well as a monthly stipend of 30,000\\nNigerian naira\\n(US$83.33).\\nNpower is a social investment scheme initiated by President Muhammadu Buhari on 8 June 2016 in an attempt to boost youths\\' employment rate.

This program provided no-cost loans to its beneficiaries, helping reduce the start-up costs of business ventures in Nigeria. The programs include: TraderMoni,\\nMarketMoni\\nand FarmerMoni.\\nThe National Home Grown School Feeding Program (NHGSF) attempted to increase school enrolment by providing free meals to schoolchildren, particularly those in poor and food-insecure regions. The program worked with local farmers and aimed to empower women as cooks, building the community and sustaining economic growth from farm to table.\\nThe program was previously co-ordinated from the office of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, until 2019, when the program was moved to the new Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development under\\nSadiya Umar Farouq\\n.
