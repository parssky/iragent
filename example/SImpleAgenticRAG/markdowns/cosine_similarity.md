# Cosine Similarity

Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors in an inner product space.
It is commonly used in natural language processing and information retrieval.

## Formula
cos(θ) = (A · B) / (||A|| * ||B||)

## Pros
- Scale-invariant.
- Works well for text similarity.

## Cons
- Requires non-zero vectors.
