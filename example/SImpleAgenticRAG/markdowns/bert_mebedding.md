# BERT Embeddings

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a transformer-based model for natural language understanding.

## Key Points
- Trained on large text corpora.
- Produces contextualized embeddings.
- Often fine-tuned for specific NLP tasks.

## Usage
1. Tokenize text using the BERT tokenizer.
2. Pass tokens through the BERT model.
3. Extract the hidden states as embeddings.
